# How the scraper hangs together

This document explains how a scrape runs, from the **Run** button to a wallpaper on disk and in the database. All paths are relative to `AStarDev.ScraperPlaying/` unless stated.

## 1. The big picture

The app is an Avalonia desktop UI over a pipeline that talks to the Wallhaven API, downloads images, and records them in a SQLite database (EF Core, `packages/AStarDev.ControlDb`).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UI["Avalonia UI<br/>MainWindow"] --> Svc["Scraping<br/>ScrapeService → SearchOrchestrator → PagesProcessor"]
    Svc --> Ing["WallpaperIngestion<br/>download, save, record"]
    Svc --> API[("Wallhaven API<br/>search + detail JSON")]
    Ing --> API
    Ing --> CDN[("Wallhaven image host")]
    Ing --> Disk[/"Disk<br/>saved images"/]
    Svc --> DB[("SQLite<br/>ControlDb")]
    Ing --> DB
    Ing -. "ImageDownloadNotifier event" .-> UI
```

Folders are grouped by domain, not by type:

| Folder | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `UI/` | Windows, button handlers, status log, image preview |
| `Operations/` | `OperationCoordinator` - one operation at a time, plus cancellation |
| `Scoping/` | `ScopedRunner` - runs work inside a DI scope |
| `Scraping/` | Paging through search results, resume logic, API client, rate limiting, tags |
| `WallpaperIngestion/` | Deciding what is new, downloading, saving, recording, announcing |
| `ScrapeConfiguration/` | Loading, editing, importing and exporting the configuration |
| `Startup/` | DI registration and database initialisation |

## 2. The call chain

Each layer does one job and hands down to the next.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["MainWindow.RunScraper<br/>builds ScrapeSelection from the 3 switches"] --> B["ScrapeActions.RunScraperAsync"]
    B --> C["ScrapeRunner.RunAsync<br/>Task.Run, reports failures to status"]
    C --> D["ScrapeService.RunScraperAsync<br/>single active operation, timing, one failure report"]
    D --> E["ScopedRunner.RunAsync&lt;IUnitOfWork, ISearchOrchestrator&gt;<br/>new DI scope per scrape"]
    E --> F["SearchOrchestrator.RunSearchesAsync<br/>hot, top, then each category"]
    F --> G["PagesProcessor.FetchAndProcessPagesAsync<br/>one search, page by page"]
    G --> H["PageIngestionStep.IngestPageAsync<br/>one page, then SaveChanges"]
    H --> I["WallpaperIngestionService.IngestPageAsync<br/>split new vs existing"]
    I --> J["NewWallpaperIngestor<br/>FetchTagsAsync / IngestAsync"]
    J --> K["WallpaperFiler.FileAsync<br/>save, link tags, announce"]
    K --> L["WallpaperSaver.SaveAsync"]
    L --> M["ImageDownloader.DownloadAsync"]
    L --> N["WallpaperFileRecorder.Record"]
    K --> O["TagLinker.LinkTagsAsync"]
    K --> P["ImageDownloadNotifier.NotifyImageDownloaded"]
```

### What each class does

| Class | Method | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `UI/MainWindow` | `RunScraper` | Reads the hot, top and categories switches into a `ScrapeSelection` |
| `UI/ScrapeActions` | `RunScraperAsync`, `CancelOperation` | Button actions; cancel calls `OperationCoordinator.Cancel` |
| `UI/ScrapeRunner` | `RunAsync` | Runs the scrape on the thread pool, so continuations never resume on the UI thread; catches anything that escapes |
| `Scraping/ScrapeService` | `RunScraperAsync` | Takes the single-operation lock via `OperationCoordinator.TryStart`, times the run, reports completion, cancellation or failure once |
| `Scoping/ScopedRunner` | `RunAsync` | Creates a DI scope so scoped services (DbContext, tag linker) live for exactly one scrape |
| `Scraping/SearchOrchestrator` | `RunSearchesAsync` | Builds a `PageScrapeRequest` for hot, top, and each included category (honouring `ScrapeSelection` and `ScrapeLimits`); a `PageFetchException` ends only that search |
| `Scraping/PagesProcessor` | `FetchAndProcessPagesAsync` | Resolves the start page, applies the resume policy, loops over pages with a pacing delay |
| `Scraping/ScrapeResumePolicy` | `ResumePage`, `IsUnchangedSincePreviousScrape`, `IsLastPageToVisit` | Pure decisions: where to resume, whether to skip a finished category, when to stop |
| `Scraping/PageIngestionStep` | `IngestPageAsync` | Ingests one page, records category progress, calls `SaveChangesAsync`; on cancel it saves what was downloaded so far |
| `WallpaperIngestion/WallpaperIngestionService` | `IngestPageAsync` | Asks the DB which wallpapers already exist, skips those, pipelines tag fetching for the rest |
| `WallpaperIngestion/NewWallpaperIngestor` | `FetchTagsAsync`, `IngestAsync` | Fetches tags; wallpapers with an "ignore" tag are remembered and not downloaded |
| `WallpaperIngestion/WallpaperFiler` | `FileAsync` | Chooses directory and file name from tags, saves, links tags, announces |
| `WallpaperIngestion/WallpaperSaver` | `SaveAsync` | Downloads the image, then records a `FileEntity` |
| `WallpaperIngestion/ImageDownloader` | `DownloadAsync` | Paced download to a `.part` file, then moved into place |
| `Scraping/TagLinker` | `LinkTagsAsync` | Creates or reuses `TagEntity` rows and links them to the file |

## 3. End-to-end sequence

```mermaid

    participant UI as MainWindow / ScrapeRunner
    participant Svc as ScrapeService
    participant Orc as SearchOrchestrator
    participant Pg as PagesProcessor
    participant Step as PageIngestionStep

    Svc->>DB: load ScrapeConfiguration (inside a new scope)

        Pg->>API: fetch resume page
        Pg->>Pg: ResumePolicy: skip category if unchanged
        loop each page

            Step->>Ing: IngestPageAsync(wallpapers)
            Ing->>DB: which handles already exist?
            loop each new wallpaper
                Ing->>API: GET detail (tags)
                Ing->>Img: GET image (after pacing delay)
                Ing->>DB: add FileEntity + tag links (tracked)
            end
            Step->>DB: SaveChanges (once per page)
            Pg->>Pg: pacing delay
            Pg->>API: fetch next page
        end
    end
    Svc-->>UI: "Search completed in ..."
```

## 4. Page loop and resume logic

A category is only ever marked as progressed when a page was **fully** ingested. If any wallpaper on a page fails, progress stops moving, so the next scrape retries from that page.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S["Start search"] --> R["resumePage = ResumePolicy.ResumePage(previous progress)"]
    R --> F1["Fetch resumePage"]
    F1 --> Same{"resumePage > 1 and<br/>same category as last time?<br/>(total + last page match)"}
    Same -- "no" --> F2["Fetch page 1 instead"]
    Same -- "yes" --> U
    F2 --> U{"Unchanged and fully<br/>scraped last time?"}
    U -- "yes" --> Skip["Report 'nothing has changed' and stop"]
    U -- "no" --> Tally["Tally.RecordSkipped for pages resumed past"]
    Tally --> Ing["IngestPageAsync(page)"]
    Ing --> Out{"Outcome"}
    Out -- "Complete and progress not withheld" --> Rec["OnPageCompleted: record last page and total on the category"]
    Out -- "Incomplete" --> With["Withhold progress from here on"]
    Rec --> Last
    With --> Last
    Ing --> Save["SaveChanges"]
    Last{"IsLastPageToVisit?<br/>page >= LastPage or MaximumPagesPerSearch"}
    Last -- "yes" --> Done["End search"]
    Last -- "no" --> Wait["Task.Delay(DownloadPacing) - avoids HTTP 429"]
    Wait --> Next["Fetch next page"] --> Ing
```

Hot and top have no stored progress (`Option.None`), so they always start at page 1.

## 5. Ingesting one page

`WallpaperIngestionService` pipelines the work: while one wallpaper downloads and is recorded, the next wallpaper's tags are already being fetched. The two are never parallel with themselves, so the API limit and the single, non-thread-safe `DbContext` are both respected.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    P["Page of wallpapers (Data[])"] --> Q["FilesQuery.GetExistingHandlesAsync"]
    Q -- "query failed" --> Inc1["Incomplete, reported"]
    Q --> Split["SplitNewCandidates"]
    Split -- "already in DB" --> Skip["Tally.RecordSkipped(1)"]
    Split -- "new" --> Pre["Prefetch tags for wallpaper 0"]
    Pre --> Loop["for each new wallpaper"]
    Loop --> Tags{"Tags fetched?"}
    Tags -- "no" --> Inc2["Incomplete"]
    Tags -- "yes" --> Ign{"Any tag flagged IgnoreImage?"}
    Ign -- "yes" --> Rem["IgnoredWallpaperRecorder.Remember<br/>counts as Complete"]
    Ign -- "no" --> File["WallpaperFiler.FileAsync"]
    File --> Ok{"Result"}
    Ok -- "saved and linked" --> Cmp["Complete"]
    Ok -- "link failed" --> Disc["Discard FileEntity, Incomplete"]
    Ok -- "exception" --> Inc3["Incomplete, reported, not thrown"]
```

The next wallpaper's tag fetch is started before the current one is filed (`prefetch` in `IngestNewWallpapersAsync`).

### Filing one wallpaper

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T["tags"] --> Dir["SaveDirectories.For(tags)<br/>famous root or normal root, tag-name segment, category segment"]
    T --> Name["WallpaperFileNamer.Create(id, extension, tags)"]
    Dir --> Req["WallpaperFileRequest"]
    Name --> Req
    Req --> Dl["ImageDownloader<br/>random 2-3s delay, GET, write .part, move"]
    Dl --> Rec["WallpaperFileRecorder.Record<br/>FileEntity + access detail + image detail"]
    Rec --> Link["TagLinker.LinkTagsAsync"]
    Link -- "ok" --> Ann["RecordDownload, then NotifyImageDownloaded"]
    Link -- "fails or cancelled" --> Del["Delete FileEntity"]
```

The file is recorded **before** the tags are linked. If linking fails, the entity is discarded, because otherwise the page save would keep an untagged file that later scrapes would treat as already ingested.

## 6. Counting: the "(x of y)" in the preview

`IngestionRun` carries a mutable `ScrapeTally` for the lifetime of one search.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Pg["PageIngestionStep<br/>Tally.Total = Meta.Total"] --> T(("ScrapeTally<br/>Total, Current"))
    Resume["PagesProcessor<br/>RecordSkipped((startPage - 1) x perPage)"] --> T
    Exist["WallpaperIngestionService<br/>RecordSkipped(1) per existing wallpaper"] --> T
    Dl["WallpaperFiler<br/>RecordDownload()"] --> T
    T --> Info["WallpaperInfo.Count (SearchCount)"]
    Info --> Lbl["CategoryDescription: 'Top Wallpapers (1,234 of 5,678)'"]
```

`x` therefore means downloaded plus skipped, so a partially scraped category shows a sensible number. The skip count for a resumed category is an estimate (start page number minus one, times the wallpapers on that page).

## 7. The preview: from background thread to UI

Ingestion runs on a thread-pool thread, so the preview is decoupled by an event and a coalescing decoder.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Filer as WallpaperFiler (scrape thread)
    participant Notif as ImageDownloadNotifier (singleton)
    participant Coord as ImageDisplayCoordinator (singleton)
    participant Panel as ImagePreviewPanel (UI)

    Filer->>Notif: NotifyImageDownloaded(details)
    Notif-->>Coord: ImageDownloaded event
    alt IsEnabled and not already decoding
        Coord->>Coord: Task.Run decode to PNG (max 1280px)
    else already decoding
        Coord->>Coord: keep only the newest waiting image
    end
    Coord-->>Panel: ImageReady(WallpaperPreviewImage)
    Panel->>Panel: Dispatcher.UIThread.Post(DisplayImage)
```

If downloads outpace decoding, intermediate images are dropped and only the latest is shown. A decode failure is swallowed, because a missing preview is not worth stopping a scrape.

Progress text follows a similar path: `ScrapeRunner` hands `IProgress<string>` to `StatusReporter`, which appends to the status log.

## 8. HTTP pipeline and rate limiting

There are three separate throttles. They exist because the Wallhaven API and the image host behave differently.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Code["JsonResponseProcessor / ImageDownloader"] --> Client["HttpClient<br/>from WallhavenClientFactory"]
    Client --> H1["WallhavenApiKeyHandler<br/>strip API key from non-API requests"]
    H1 --> H2["WallhavenRateLimitingHandler<br/>API only: sliding window permit,<br/>retry 429 using Retry-After, up to 3 times"]
    H2 --> Net(("Network"))
```

| Throttle | Where | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| Sliding-window `RateLimiter` plus 429 retry | `WallhavenRateLimitingHandler` | Every request to the API path (search pages, tag detail) |
| Random 2-3s `DownloadPacing` | `ImageDownloader` | Before each image download |
| Same `DownloadPacing` | `PagesProcessor` | Before each page after the first, so skipping already-ingested pages does not trigger 429s |

Image downloads are not rate limited by the handler, and the API key is removed from them so it is never sent to the image host.

## 9. Cancellation, single-operation and failure rules

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Running: OperationCoordinator.TryStart
    Running --> Running: TryStart refused ("already running")
    Running --> Cancelling: Cancel() on the token source
    Cancelling --> Idle: OperationCanceledException caught in ScrapeService
    Running --> Idle: Completed
    Running --> Idle: Failed, reported once with message chain
    note right of Cancelling
        PageIngestionStep saves wallpapers
        already downloaded this page
        before the cancellation propagates
    end note
```

Failure scoping, from narrowest to widest:

- A wallpaper that fails to download or link is reported, the page is marked `Incomplete`, the scrape continues.
- A page that cannot be fetched throws `PageFetchException`, which ends only that search; the next search still runs, and its progress is withheld so it resumes next time.
- Anything else, or a cancellation, propagates to `ScrapeService`, the one place a scrape failure is reported.

## 10. Dependency injection and lifetimes

`Startup/ApplicationServices.cs` composes everything. The rule: a service's lifetime must not be longer than any of its dependencies'.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Singleton
        SS["ScrapeService"]
        SR["ScopedRunner"]
        OC["OperationCoordinator"]
        RP["ScrapeResumePolicy"]
        RL["RateLimiter"]
        DP["DownloadPacing"]
        IN["ImageDownloadNotifier"]
        IDC["ImageDisplayCoordinator"]
        Q["IQuery implementations"]
        DF["DbContext factory"]
    end
    subgraph Scoped["Scoped (one per scrape)"]
        UOW["IUnitOfWork = ControlDbContext"]
        SO["SearchOrchestrator"]
        PP["PagesProcessor"]
        PS["PageIngestionStep"]
        WIS["WallpaperIngestionService"]
        WF["WallpaperFiler / Saver"]
        TL["TagLinker"]
        TFS["TagFlagStore"]
    end
    SS --> SR
    SR -- "creates scope" --> Scoped
    SO --> PP --> PS --> WIS --> WF --> TL
    PS --> UOW
    TL --> UOW
```

`ScrapeService` is a singleton, so it never takes scoped dependencies directly. It asks `ScopedRunner` for a fresh scope per scrape instead. The `IQuery<T>` implementations are singletons because the DbContext factory is a singleton and builds the context from the root provider, so a scoped dependency there would fail.

An integration test (`GivenTheApplicationServices`) builds the container with scope and build validation on, so a captive dependency fails the build.

## 11. Persistence

The main entities, all in `packages/AStarDev.ControlDb`:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ScrapeConfigurationEntity ||--o{ SearchCategoryEntity : has
    FileEntity ||--|| FileAccessDetailEntity : has
    FileEntity ||--o| ImageDetailEntity : has
    FileEntity ||--o{ FileTagEntity : tagged
    TagEntity ||--o{ FileTagEntity : used
```

| Entity | Role in a scrape |
|---|---|
| `ScrapeConfigurationEntity` | API key, base URL, hot and top settings, search string prefix and suffix, root directories |
| `SearchCategoryEntity` | A category; stores `LastKnownImageCount`, `LastPageVisited`, `TotalPages` for resume |
| `FileEntity` | One saved wallpaper; its `FileHandle` is the Wallhaven id, which is how "already exists" is detected |
| `TagEntity` / `FileTagEntity` | Tags and their links; flags (ignore, name, famous) decide skipping and directories |

`IUnitOfWork` commits once per page (`PageIngestionStep`), so a page is saved as one batch.

## 12. Where to look when...

| You want to change | Start at |
|---|---|
| Which scrapes run, or limits | `SearchOrchestrator`, `ScrapeSelection`, `ScrapeLimits` |
| Resume / skip rules | `ScrapeResumePolicy`, `PagesProcessor` |
| Waits between requests | `DownloadPacing`, `WallhavenRateLimitingHandler`, `ApplicationConstants` |
| Where files are saved and named | `SaveDirectories`, `SaveDirectoryResolver`, `WallpaperFileNamer` |
| What is recorded in the DB | `WallpaperFileRecorder`, `TagLinker` |
| What is ignored | `TagFlagStore`, `TagFetcher`, `IgnoredWallpaperRecorder` |
| The preview and counts | `ImageDisplayCoordinator`, `ImagePreviewPanel`, `ScrapeTally`, `WallpaperInfo` |
| Service wiring | `Startup/ApplicationServices.cs`, `Startup/DataServices.cs` |
