# Documentation

Architecture decisions, guides, and reference material for the AStar Development
mono-repo. This folder is the long-form companion to the [repo README](../README.md)
— the README tells you how to use the repo day-to-day; this folder explains the
decisions behind it.

## Architecture decisions

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document significant choices made in this
repo — what was decided, why, and what alternatives were considered. They are
written once and rarely updated; if a decision is reversed, a new ADR is written
rather than editing the old one.

| # | Title | Status | Date |
|---|-------|--------|------|
| [001](adr/001-mono-repo.md) | Adopt a mono-repo structure | Accepted | _yyyy-mm-dd_ |
| [002](adr/002-central-package-management.md) | Use Central Package Management | Accepted | _yyyy-mm-dd_ |
| [003](adr/003-avalonia-for-desktop.md) | Avalonia for cross-platform desktop | Accepted | _yyyy-mm-dd_ |
| [004](adr/004-github-packages-for-nuget.md) | GitHub Packages as NuGet feed | Accepted | _yyyy-mm-dd_ |
| [005](adr/005-slnx-solution-format.md) | Use SLNX solution format | Accepted | _yyyy-mm-dd_ |

### Adding a new ADR

Copy `adr/000-template.md`, increment the number, and fill in the sections.
Keep ADRs short — one page is the target. The goal is to capture the reasoning,
not write an essay.
